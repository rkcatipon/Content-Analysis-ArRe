 Utility's rates , Old Market fire on minds of candidates for MUD board  Political newcomer Krystal Gabel says she's plenty comfortable being the only woman in a field of four contenders vying for two seats on the Metropolitan Utilities District board of directors .  Gabel , 31 , a technical writer for a local payments software company , said her relative youth and perspective would be an asset to the seven-member board .  \" I have a new perspective on things , and while I don't want to play the gender card , there are a lot of men on the board , \" she said . \" When you lack equal representation , you're basically shutting out large populations from policymaking . \"  Gabel also takes issue with what she says is the high fixed service charge on customers ' monthly bills . She said she wants to steer the utility toward increased transparency by showing ratepayers exactly what those charges fund within the district . Gabel also advocates more stringent water-quality standards and said she shares ratepayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion and fire in the Old Market .  Long-serving incumbent board member Jack Frost , who is seeking re-election for a sixth term , touts his decades of experience on the board as his prime asset .  \" My knowledge and experience in the field is significant . Every time you get someone new on the board , it takes a long time before they become knowledgeable , \" he said .  Frost , 84 , said he would keep pushing the utility to new business opportunities like the recent water service boundary agreement with Gretna and Papillion . Agreements like those could boost MUD's water volumes , thereby increasing revenue and helping offset the costs of infrastructure .  Frost declined to comment on the utility's role in the blaze that destroyed a historic structure near 11th and Howard Streets in January , but he said he is \" comfortable \" with the utility's response to the explosion and subsequent fire in the heart of the Old Market . Citing pending litigation tied to the incident , the 30-year board member declined to comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 68 , a retired Northern Natural Gas executive and former MUD board appointee . The ratepayer-owned utility needs to be more transparent about what it does know about the incident , he said .  \" I can understand that some issues can't be discussed in public . The problem I have is that the public wants to know what facts are out there ( that can be discussed ) , \" McGowan said . \" You can't hide all the facts behind the lawsuits . \"  McGowan said his career experience working with utilities like MUD makes him a top choice for ratepayers who expect transparency , safety and cost management .  Despite opposition from labor unions , McGowan said he worked in the interest of ratepayers during his two-year stint on the board in the early 2000s , a period in which he pushed for outsourcing of certain projects to save money and for increased employee contributions to the MUD pension fund .  Retired MUD executive Tom Wurtz said voters should choose him for his 30 years of experience with the district and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wurtz said the expertise he gained in positions including general counsel and president would provide vital insight when it comes to analyzing gaps in the budget and avoiding rate increases , for example .  That expertise also informs his criticism of MUD's rate structure , which he says unfairly burdens people living in smaller homes and apartments with higher fixed service charges despite lower gas and water consumption . Instead , MUD should make up revenue shortfalls with new wholesale customers , he said .  Like Gabel and McGowan , Wurtz also said the utility's ratepayers deserve more answers about what happened in the Old Market in January .  \" There seems to be a reliance on the fact that it's in litigation that they don't have to come forward with any of the changes they're making , \" Wurtz said . \" Frankly , I don't think they have come clean with the public on this . \"  This year's is the last election in which MUD board members are elected at large . In 2018 , those members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchanged .
