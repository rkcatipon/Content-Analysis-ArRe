# Project Pitch

At the behest of the Atlantic Council, a think tank with ties to NATO and U.S. defense groups, a swath of Facebook pages that were said to be spreading disinformation were “purged” from the site. However, many of these pages were critical of U.S. foreign policy, leading to concerns about rising censorship on the social media platform. In this project, we would like to study the  Facebook purge using text analysis methods. Specifically, we will explore whether the presence of certain topics related to national security and the positions media outlets take on them can be correlated with an increased risk of censorship. 

In order to detect these topics, we will collect and analyze text from the purged Facebook pages using methods such as LDA topic modeling and STM. Once topics related to foreign policy within the censored pages emerge, then we can compare these findings with the News dataset in the Davies Corpora to understand the semantic differences between the purged pages and mainstream media. We will, therefore, be able to model which topics trigger potential censorship.
